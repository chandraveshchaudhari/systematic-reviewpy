abstract="This paper systematically reviews the literature related to stock price prediction systems. The reviewers collected 6222 research works from 12 databases. The reviewers reviewed the full-text of 10 studies in preliminary search and 70 studies selected based on PRISMA. This paper uses the PRISMA-based Python framework systematic-reviewpy to conduct this systematic review and browser-automationpy to automate downloading of full-texts. The programming code with comprehensive documentation, citation data, input variables, and reviews spreadsheets is provided, making this review replicable, open-source, and free from human errors in selecting studies. The reviewed literature is categorized based on type of prediction systems to demonstrate the evolution of techniques and research gaps. The reviewed literature is 7 {\%} statistical, 9{\%} machine learning, 23{\%} deep learning, 20{\%} hybrid, 25{\%} combination of machine learning and deep learning, and 14{\%} studies explore multiple categories of techniques. This review provides detailed information on prediction techniques, competitor techniques, performance metrics, input variables, data timing, and research gap to enable researchers to create prediction systems per technique category. The review showed that stock trading data is most used and collected from Yahoo! Finance. Studies showed that sentiment data improved stock prediction, and most papers used tweets from Twitter. Most of the reviewed studies showed significant improvements in predictions to previous systems.",
