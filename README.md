## Introduction
The main objective of the Python framework is to automate systematic reviews to save reviewers time without creating 
constraints that might affect the review quality. The other objective is to create an open-source and highly 
customisable framework with options to use or improve any parts of the framework. python framework supports each step in
the systematic review workflow and suggests using checklists provided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Systematic-reviewpy supports the complete workflow for systematic reviews and contains 
natural language processing techniques such as stemming and lemmatisation for text mining. Systematic-reviewpy also 
automatically generates analysis tables and graphs based on the selected article list.

### Project Authors
The packages systematic-reviewpy and browser-automationpy are part of Research paper "a python framework for systematic 
review using PRISMA guidelines" created by Chandravesh chaudhari, Doctoral candidate at christ university, Bangalore 
under supervision of Dr. Geetanjali purswani.
